Description: Provides functions to implement alpha-KIDS, a model-free feature screening procedure with false discovery rate (FDR) control for ultrahigh-dimensional right-censored data. The method is robust against heavy censoring and unknown censoring mechanisms. The procedure operates in two stages: 1. Initial screening: selects a set of potentially important features using a dual screening mechanism based on nonparametric reproducing kernel-based ANOVA statistics. 2. Refined selection: applies a unified knockoff procedure to control the FDR and accurately identify the truly significant features. This package enables efficient dimension reduction and reliable feature selection in survival analysis without the need for pre-specifying model structures or making strong assumptions about the censoring mechanism. It is particularly suitable for high-throughput genomic data and other applications involving ultrahigh-dimensional covariates and censored outcomes.
